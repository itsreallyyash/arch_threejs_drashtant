# A Simple Three.js App

## Description

This project is a basic Three.js application that sets up a 3D scene and renders it in the browser. It serves as a starting point for anyone looking to get familiar with Three.js and 3D web development.

### Project Structure

The project consists of the following files and directories:

- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file that sets up the basic structure of the application.
- **`css/style.css`**: The stylesheet for the application, providing basic styles.
- **`js/main.js`**: The main JavaScript file that contains the Three.js code responsible for creating and rendering the 3D scene.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- A modern web browser with WebGL support.
- A code editor or IDE of your choice.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-threejs-app.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd simple-threejs-app
   ```

3. **Open the `index.html` file**:
   Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The Three.js scene should render automatically.

### Installing Dependencies

If you want to expand the project and manage dependencies using npm or yarn, you can install Three.js as follows:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install three

# Using yarn
yarn add three
```

## Usage

This project can be used as a foundation for building more complex Three.js applications. You can modify the existing code to create interactive 3D visualizations, games, or even virtual and augmented reality experiences.

### Example Use Cases

- Creating interactive 3D visualizations.
- Building 3D games.
- Developing virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR) experiences.
